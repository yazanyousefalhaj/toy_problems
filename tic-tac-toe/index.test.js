Imagine you are playing a game of tic-tac-toe
and you are trying to see if the current
board is solved.
If you never played the game, here is a good simulator: http://playtictactoe.org/
Assume that the board comes in the form of a 3x3 array,
where the value is 0 if a spot is empty,
1 if it is an X, or 2 if it is an O, like so:
[[0,0,1],
 [0,1,2],
 [2,1,0]]
We want our function to return -1
if the board is not solved yet, 1 if X won, 2 if O won,
or 0 if it's a draw.
You may assume that the board passed in is valid.
Example:
var board = [[0,0,1],
             [0,1,2],
             [2,1,0]];
ticTacToe(board);//should return -1
var solvedBoard = [[0,1,1],
                   [0,1,2],
                   [2,1,2]];
ticTacToe(solvedBoard);//should return 1
